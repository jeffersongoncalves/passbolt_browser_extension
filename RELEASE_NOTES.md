Passbolt v5.2.0 is now available as a release candidate 2. This version addresses an issue reported on release candidate 1, in which users did not receive an error message when drag-and-drop operations for resources or folders failed.
As always, we warmly invite the community to test these new features before the production release, and we thank everyone for their valuable feedback and bug reports.

### Fixed
- PB-43161 Fix: dragging resources or folder should display any error
